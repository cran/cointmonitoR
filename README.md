test <- monitorStationarity(x, m = 93)
print(test)
oldpar <- par(mfrow = c(2, 1))
plot(test, what = "both", legend = FALSE)
par(oldpar)
```

## Theoretical background

We propose a consistent monitoring procedure to detect a structural change from a cointegrating relationship to a spurious relationship. The procedure is based on residuals from modified least squares estimation, using either Fully Modified, Dynamic or Integrated Modified OLS. It is inspired by [Chu et al. (1996)](http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2171955) in that it is based on parameter estimation on a pre-break "calibration" period only, rather than being based on sequential estimation over the full sample.

See the [discussion paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2624657) for further information.

This package provides the monitoring procedures for both the cointegration and the stationarity case (the latter is just a special case of the former one) as well as printing and plotting methods for a clear presentation of the results.
